Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization on the Titanic Dataset, focusing on uncovering meaningful patterns, passenger characteristics, and survival insights using Python and common data-science libraries.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic Passenger Dataset, available here:
<a href="https://github.com/WebberX45/Prodigy-Infotech-Data-Science-Task-2/blob/main/train.csv">titanic_dataset.csv</a>.<br>
It contains detailed records of passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, family relationships, and survival status. This dataset enables analysis of demographic patterns, travel class impact, and key factors influencing survival outcomes.


## Objective

Analyze the Titanic dataset to:
- Understand passenger demographics
- Explore relationships between variables
- Visualize factors influencing survival


## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab


## Key Insights

Distribution of passengers by Sex, Class, Age, Embarkation Port
- Survival comparison across
   - Gender
   - Passenger class
   - Age groups
- Outlier detection and handling
- Missing value treatment


## Conclusion

This Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization highlights how socio-economic status, gender, and age strongly influenced survival chances on the Titanic. The project demonstrates the power of Python visualization to uncover patterns in real-world datasets.
